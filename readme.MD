#JavaScript 

This repository contains JavaScript tutorials created by Chris Brooksbank

JavaScript was created in ten days, in May 1995 by Brendan Eich, then working at NetScape.

JavaScript is a programming language.

A implementation of JavaScript is implemented in all major web browsers and that is a key reason for its longetivity.
If you want to run code in users web browsers you will almost certainly authoring JavaScript code.
( There is a project called WebAssembly ( see also asm.js ) to compile non JavaScript code to run on web )

JavaScript now runs in many more places than web browsers.
There is a major, established, opensource project called Node which allows JavaScript to execute on servers.
( Although it is worth noting that Node may not be the best choice for processor intensive server side code )

Douglas Crockford specified the JavaScript Object Notation Format ( JSON ) and this has surplanted the more verbose XML in many cases.
JSON came out of a simple way of defining a JavaScript object, which consists of name value pairs.

Various database engines store and retrieve data in JSON format and may utilise a query engine based on JSON querys.

Java is not JavaScript.

##JavaScript Usage
There has been an explosion in the use of JavaScript in recent years.

Here are some examples of where JavaScript is used, most of below are open source :
* JSON = Javascript object notation. A minimal readable format for structuring data.  
* V8 = JavaScript engine used in Google Chrome web browser. Compiles JavaScript and utilises many optimisation techniques. Other browsers have own optimisation technologies for JavaScript.
* node = runs JavaScript code on servers, supported by many add on frameworks and ( C ) libraries
* npm = a package manager for JavaScript
* bower = another package manager for website frontend resources
* TypeScript = A superset of JavaScript which compiles into JavaScript
* CoffeeScript = A superset of JavaScript which compiles into JavaScript
* Angular2 = a framework for web applications built by Google. ( Written in TypeScript )
* Gulp.js =  a task/build runner for developers
* Grunt = a task-based command line build tool for JavaScript projects.
* MongoDB = a database that stores data in JSON format

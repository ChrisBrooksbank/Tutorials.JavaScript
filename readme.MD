#JavaScript 

This repository contains JavaScript tutorials created by Chris Brooksbank

JavaScript was created in ten days, in May 1995 by Brendan Eich, then working at NetScape.

JavaScript is a programming language.

A implementation of JavaScript is implemented in all major web browsers and that is a key reason for its longetivity.
If you want to run code in users web browsers you will be authoring JavaScript code.

JavaScript now runs in many more places than web browsers.
There is a major, established, opensource project called Node which allows JavaScript to execute on servers.
( Although it is worth noting that Node may not be the best choice for processor intensive server side code )

Douglas Crockford specified the JavaScript Object Notation Format ( JSON ) and this has surplanted the more verbose XML in many cases.
JSON came out of a simple way of defining a JavaScript object, which consists of name value pairs.

Various database engines store and retrieve data in JSON format and may utilise a query engine based on JSON querys.

Java is not JavaScript.
